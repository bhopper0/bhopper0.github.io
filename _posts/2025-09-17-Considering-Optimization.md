title: Considering the Optimization of Teaching
---
### Version 1
A/N: I've taken out the details of the research within the seminar because I'm not sure you knowing it is essential to my point. I didn't given specifics, because not everything had been published yet, but I do feel better leaving it out generally.

I recently[^1] attended an education seminar on memory retention of chemical concepts and moose. I'll explain the latter for you: the speaker used an "undetected moose in the woods" as an analogy for large, important oversights[^2] that the chemical education sector[^3] is not currently considering in their research/studies/methods etc.[^4] It was quite fun -- every time he summarized the point he was making, he also showed a picture of a moose. 

There was a continuous thread throughout the talk of "look at all these meese in the woods, we need to consider and adjust for them in our teaching methods" and, when talking to my coworker[^8] about it, some ideas have begun to crystallize in my mind. 

In the STEM teaching course I'm currently in, the instructor has mentioned the 'expert blindspot' -- i.e. the tendency of experts to forget what learning concepts within their field **for the first time** is like. So, we should take care and all that. I agree with this. 

Maybe I should just get to my question and then provide context -- is there a need to optimize teaching, to the degree that 'cutting-edge education research' suggests? 

Do teachers really need to bend over backwards, to redo their teaching methods from scratch, to optimize their content around how students learn *best,* how content is retained in memory *best* and *for the longest amount of time*?

I guess it feels odd to hear that learning is about trial and error, and how much students learn from failure, and in the same breath, spew all this stuff about the newest and coolest and bestest way to teach. In a certain light, it almost reads as hyper-productivity propaganda?

Is my problem with chemistry education research in particular? The speaker did make some comment about how learning chemistry is inherently different from others fields, but never gave evidence of such. And, truly, I'm hard pressed to believe that it's so different.[^10] 

Maybe it's the capitalism of it all. Failure at the collegiate level is not supported: by (some) parents, or future employers,[^9] or other teachers, or etc. You can preach the benefits of failing all you'd like, but at the end of the day, students vie for points, for the grade, for the degree, for the job. Teachers can control so little of how much effort/motivation/desire the student has. 

What I'm trying to say is: is it not enough to just teach well, as best you're able? Won't caring about your students, seeing them as real people with lives and goals, and accepting that they may only have passing interest in your course get you most of the way there? And I'll admit, there are lots of ways to teach; I'm excited to (in theory) learn about how I could teach differently in the class, if I wished. I'm fully aware that how I understand things may not work for everyone. 

Maybe this is a symptom of my taking in a lot of education research all at once. I don't think that this optimization is a conscious sentiment of the education field, necessarily -- I don't know enough to substantiate that claim. I could see it more as a particular symptom of chemistry education because there is a focus on optimization within a lot of chemistry in general. But, I am starting to notice it a bit more. It's become La Croix flavoring, if you will.

Hopefully J has some thoughts on this that they'll contribute if they like. Going back and forth has been deep fun. 

Also -- I'd like to amend my ways! In "Impetus" or "Week 1 Reflection," I express my distaste about lying to students about chemical models. Teaching the fruitcake model[^11] of an atom, then the Bohr model, then electron cloud etc etc. I heard from my coworker after seminar that they teach Gen Chem students about wavefunctions,[^12] with the reasoning that they don't want to lie to them. And I... hate that a little. (Think of the confusion it could incite in students! Especially ones with little interest in or lots of trepidation about chemistry!) I think, when I was learning chemistry, I was taught through the repeated corrections of "lies." This was fine for me because oooo mysterious, and also I liked chemistry for other reasons so it didn't matter anyway. But just reframing it as "there are a bunch of different models, here's the one you're gonna learn right now, there are others that people consider more accurate, talk to me after class or take advanced classes" is enough. Science is all models, as J has pointed out, and it's a very important lesson that students would do well to learn regardless. Arguably, this take is the *most* truthful out of all of them too. 

That's all, folks, I just needed to get this out of my brain. I gotta go see about some fountain pens.

[^1]: two hours ago

[^2]: the meese. yes, the incorrect plural, no, I don't care

[^3]: the woods

[^4]: undetected

[^8]: bless him for going to these with me

[^9]: particularly if its a company, or for STEM, the ~industry~

[^10]: shocker, I don't think chemistry is the pick-me girl of STEM

[^11]: or was it pudding? it was some kind of food...

[^12]: another model, but one you learn in advanced chemistry courses because it's based in multi-variable calculus and difficult to think about
