title: Wk 1 Reading Reflection 
---

The syllabus I'm following asks for reading reflections after each week, and while those responses are suggested to max out at a paragraph, I will be doing no such thing.[^1] 

Generally, these readings consider the question: *Why is science literacy not more widely used, given how touted it is in Western culture and education philosophy?* This is not quite the question that the syllabus posits,[^2] but it's what the papers are directly grappling with. One reading steps back to more rigorously define what it means to be scientifically literate,[^3] and the other contends with science literacy circa-2020, in what they call a "post-truth era." (I'm pleased that the latter paper was included, if only to signal that the class/professor is in touch with the modern times).[^4]

Now, onto the meat. What did I think of these readings...

I mean, a lot of this information was not surprising. Science literacy is best achieved when one neither assumes a canonical definition[^5] or a universal prescriptive method for teaching it. More generally, assuming science is the field of infallible, objective truth does more harm than good, especially with the rise of current...sentiments.[^6] A large focus for both readings was the idea of placing science "in context" with other fields, i.e. using science (or the scientific method at the very least) to address issues in personal, social, civic discourse. Thankfully, both authors[^7] acknowledge that this idea has been discussed in the public engagement and social studies fields for ages already.[^8] As is the case with most things, giving people reason(s) to personally care about what they're learning often does, in fact, make them more interested in what's being taught. I keep trying to come up with an alternate title, like "Surprise, Interdisciplinary Learning Also Applies to Science" or "Surprise, Contextual Learning Matters" or "Surprise, Teaching Science is Not That Different from Any Other Course," but nothing's really singing to me so I'm putting them here. 

What most caught my idea was this focus on *collective knowing*. As is (potentially) intuitive, Western education consists of mainly an "individualist" approach to education and assessments: i.e. that the *individual* is taught and the educator assesses the *individual* on their knowledge. Scale this *n* number of times for *n* number of students being taught and hey-ho you've got the traditional US classroom. But there also exists[^9] a "collective/sociocultural" approach: where meaning/knowledge is made *collectively* amongst a group, using sociocultural tools[^10] to supplement/support/negate certain ideas where necessary. 

If I just transcribe my stream of consciousness for a moment: I can certainly see the prominence of this kind of approach[^11] in daily life, but I struggle to see how it gets realized into a teaching method. Well, that's not quite true: the classic example is group projects. But then there's the whole sentiment *around* group projects -- and why is that? A few reasons but I feel like it boils down to unfair distribution of labor.[^12]  If some group members take advantage of the collective approach, then the others feel they must pick up the slack. And then again, are group projects even a way of instigating "collective knowing"? A group project has a singular, shared goal, sure, but because (theoretically) each student has a similar knowledge level, and group projects usually attempt to summarize a student's learning up until that point, I'm not sure it invites a collective knowledge approach? More just: "I like making presentations, so I'll do that, and you guys like writing so you'll take the report and" etc. etc. 

I had a wonderful social studies teacher in middle school, who took an approach to group projects that I enjoyed. It was much looser: form groups, then pick X topic/stance[^13], research for Y days, then debate other teams with him as presiding judge. The teams who presented a well-researched, well-argued defense of their topic won the debate, regardless of the stance.[^14] This feels closer to a collective approach towards knowledge: people could choose what they were most interested/familiar with to research, and then you come together to draft an argument which synthesizes everything. It was a collective debate, but each student had to go against another student on the other team -- so if someone failed to research well, it was obvious. And, I suppose, there was not an "assessment" portion of this; it wasn't a project. You got bragging rights[^15] but we weren't given a formal grade, which is an important piece, I think, though I won't discuss how right now.

I've been mulling over an idea which I think could be quite fun in a science (or science comms) course which at least attempts to put scientific knowledge in context with daily life. Students form groups, then find a topic related to something happening in town: fish population in local river declining? Investigate water conditions or predator populations for that species of fish. Certain crops not doing well? Investigate growing zones, soil health, increases in plant diseases/pest population, or native alternatives. More instances of people fainting around park/church/school? Investigate AC and airflow in buildings, lack of shade increasing ground temperature, lack of seating for long events etc. Even taking a civic issue and applying the scientific method towards finding a solution. Cherry on the cake would be going to town hall and discussing the final piece there. Grounded in life, lots of opportunities to investigate what each individual finds interesting, but then having to integrate individual portions towards a collective issue. 

Another piece of this collective knowing: how do students learn hard concepts really? Do they learn it from their teacher, or do they learn it from other students when its midnight before homework is due and they were too scared to go to office hours? There is an undeniable power imbalance between student and teacher,[^16] and it's ignorant to assume it wouldn't also affect learning, especially when the weaker party is the one who must learn. 

Okay, let's pull it back. I agree very generally with the arguments put forth by the authors, and think it's worthwhile information to consider. I think this applies to lower level chemistry mostly though? General Chemistry, yeah, middle- and high-school chem, yes, but what about the higher level courses? Organic Chem if you tied in more connections to pharma and...whatever other contexts it might be useful in.[^17] AChem, probably, but PChem? 

I suppose this is my white whale. In what ways can you teach PChem other than what's already done? When I talked to the prof I got this syllabus from about whether anyone did chemical education research on PChem in particular, they said no. So, I'll be trying to keep that in mind as we (me)[^18] go through the readings. Equally, with the way education is currently run, to talk about a collective approach to knowledge, I think you must also talk about assessments, so I'm excited to get to that week.

Finally, why start here for this course? Why start with a reflection on science literacy? The question listed in the syllabus (in footnote 2, which I'll pull into the main text for the creatures who didn't read that footnote) is: "What is the point of science literacy?"
Since this is a course on Chemical Education, the implicit assumption is that a student who has successfully taken a science course will then be scientifically literate. Maybe you start here because you'd like it to be the base achievement: at the very least, students who take a science course should have learned the skills to be scientifically literate. Maybe more generally it's just "what is scientific literacy?," to introduce us to the idea. Maybe science literacy is the best lens to start with, so that we[^19] (the classmates?) might start to think about pedagogy as a whole...

Well, maybe that answer will come later. This is probably enough as a first reflection, and I think it's good that this one diverges as much as it does.

[^1]: I understand that there's worth in brevity, but I'm not actually taking this course, so I believe it will be more useful if I allow myself to wander. Also you (with the exception of a dear friend, but otherwise likely) are not taking this course either, so I need to explain more than I would otherwise.

[^2]: What is the point of science literacy?

[^3]: They argue that being scientifically literate means having *useful* scientific skills and knowledge to help with personal, social, and civic problems, and they feel passionately that not all skills/knowledge taught in science courses are strictly "useful"

[^4]: To be clear, I'm not saying that this is/was happening, just that I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't some small part of the reason

[^5]: i.e. having a strong understanding of fundamental concepts and/or knowing and utilizing the scientific method and/or knowing how to interpret scientific findings. If you haven't already guessed, the classical definition is not rigorous or universal. 

[^6]: woah, shocker.

[^7]: or series of authors

[^8]: Which, in and of itself, demonstrates that science-as-objective-truth (or the value superiority of harder sciences over softer ones, say sociology) is the incorrect mode of thinking

[^9]: according to these authors

[^10]: lived experience is one such tool, but there are certainly others (ancestral knowledge, intersectional identities etc)

[^11]: paper authors call this "sense-making," but I genuinely hate that term and will not be using it

[^12]: then, directly following, how group members get accessed: as a group, or as individuals. 

[^13]: from what I remember, it was either a topic during a certain historical period, or he would randomly assign teams to a certain stance: "were FDR's actions justified, or tyrannical?" 

[^14]: a very helpful lesson in the advantages of rigorous research, and that your research is only as good as how well you present it

[^15]: which, in middle school, for the most popular class with the favorite teacher, was quite the prize

[^16]: I think there is a large difference in the power dynamic between student and teacher, than student and mentor, or apprentice and mentor. Maybe should be more precise and say student and *lecturer*

[^17]: I know there are others, but I can't be bothered rn lol

[^18]: well, me plus friend

[^19]: who we, the audience, are supposed to be for this course is a fascinating question: are we future educators? are we future education researchers? who is this class *for* exactly? in any case, it does affect the "why start here" question, which is why I'm including all the maybes
