title: Considering Smartphones
---

### Version 1
I've just finished watching a semi-old,[^1] very popular[^2] youtube video about a man locking his smartphone in a safe for a month. The results were as you'd expect, given that smartphones are designed to garner our attention as often and for as long as possible.[^3] So, let's extend the thought experiment here. Could I, too, lock my phone in a safe? 

(I don't want to buy a safe and I don't own one,[^4] so let's just call that "leaving my phone at home during the day." Or, maybe deleting a bunch of apps/adjusting notifications such that it becomes a very glossy brick phone). 

What apps would I get rid of? Social media and streaming services (Instagram, tumblr, snapchat, youtube, netflix etc), phone games (though I don't have many cause I don't play them), discord?

I could truly go all out and make it functionally a landline: only texting and calling. No music, no reading etc, or I could tailor it to what I know my time sinks are. 

Like, banking apps. I would probably keep those, cause... we do live in a capitalist society. Other money apps (Venmo for instance) would stay. All my work apps would probably stay. Teams, email, Duo,[^5] Podcasts and music? I'm not really listening to podcasts at the moment, but no music would be really tough. Japanese learning apps? If I kept them, maybe I would actually use them more often... 

Reading apps? See, this is a tough one. On the one hand, I adore the Libby app and use it frequently -- its how I read my library books. It wouldn't be horrible if I didn't have it, cause I would just need to go by the library more often, which could be nice. Maybe it would help me not buy so many books? Cause dopamine rush of picking up physical library book same to buying one???

But what about my silly lil webcomics? I do read those often, but they're finite -- comics are only released once a day, and they have a definitive end to them. So they're not really a time sink...

My big initial concern was long distance friends. I have many of them -- and they're very dear to me. Snapchat is one of the ways I keep in touch with some of them. If I got rid of it completely, that would be troublesome. I suppose I could just *do* Snapchat via text[^6]. I guess I could keep the app?

Hmm maybe this is the question. I can't just remove the app from my home screen, but still have it downloaded -- I already do that, and it's not a big enough obstacle for my brain. So either: 1) I delete the apps from my phone and find another way or 2) I keep the app and just leave my entire phone at home during the day.

Leaving my phone at home during the day I think would be the best option. Maybe I would become a better texter, if I relegated noticing and answering them to a set portion of time before or after work. I guess the worry is, what if something urgent comes up? With my family, or with my partner? There's a mixture of iMessage and SMS texters in that group, and I don't have texts come through on my laptop anyway. If there was an emergency... then what?

With regards to my partner, at least right now, someone could walk up a flight of stairs and come grab me. So that's kind of fine. But my family? 2/3rds of them have little or no sense of consideration for when an appropriate time to tell me serious things is. And, often, an unanswered text after some period of time will generate more texts trying to get my attention. 

I guess they would just have to figure that out themselves? I am trying to get closer to my brother though... but there are better ways to build a relationship with him than a vague "being available." I suppose I could tell them beforehand that I was going to do this??? That might have the additional benefit of providing a boundary. Hmmm. 

Okay, so back to the options. If I left my phone at home, and kept the apps, then I could still keep in touch with long distance friends using them.

But keeping the apps on my phone still kind of leaves the same problem. What if I fill my home time with phone instead of all the other things I want to do? I already deal with that problem now. Maybe I delete the apps that I could easily access via computer (streaming, insta) and keep the ones that don't computerize well on my phone (snap)? 

I could delete the computer-transferable ones, keep the others, and take my phone to work? Then use of phone would be: read, work stuff, or music? Then I could lie and say I *was* leaving my phone at home to necessary family, so maybe they would still contact me within those hours? Nah, they wouldn't do that; they would just text me whenever and figure that I would see it "when I got home," but I would see it then cause I lied and then nothing is solved.

I could do that, not lie, and make really strict Work-Focus settings on my phone? 

Ugh, but I think the compulsion would remain-- if I have the ability to check my phone, regardless of how hard I make it to check, I will check. Because phone = big dopamine boost. 

God, what if I deleted my work apps? What a delight that would be. No email, no teams, no canvas on my phone. Only computer.... Need to think on that.

(I'm reading over what I've already written to see where I've landed amidst all this.)

Okay, so seems like bringing the phone to work, regardless of the level of its capabilities (unless it were truly a brick) would not work, at least at the beginning, when the compulsion to check is really strong. 

God, if I didn't bring it, I would have no music at work. Well, you know, I can't listen to worded music when I'm doing office work anyway. I do like playing it (at a soft volume, for safety) while in lab, sooooo that would suck. I don't think I own a iPod touch or etc anymore, so I can't do that. I'd like to not buy anything if I don't have to?

Ugh, I can't even try it for one day, bc of Duo. I would need to get the substitute first. Which is okay, but is a barrier for the experiment, and ... brain. 

I could have discipline? And bring it, but try not to look at it. Put it in an inconvenient place. 

Services? I know there's Brick -- and I've definitively gotten ads (lmao) for a cheaper alternative to Brick (that will likely get advertised to me again now that I've looked it up). Could Brick the phone, leave the Brick at home, then take the phone to work? There's apparently 5 "Emergency unBricks" through the app, but I don't know when those renew (if at all?) so I don't think I would be tempted to use them... 

Gosh, but how is that different from deleting the app? How does this address the home-time-phone-usage worry from before? I think I need to sleep, and sit on it...


### Version 2
It's been many sleeps since last draft, so let's see where my mind landed. I also read back through Version 1 to get a handle on where I ended last time.[^7] 

I know I'm very capable of not checking things when I put my mind to it. While I'm not religious anymore,[^8] a couple years ago I decided to give up socials for Lent, just to see. And I successfully did not check them for the whole 40 days (and I was better for it). This success I largely attribute to the presence of the Lenten season and old engrained habits of practicing said season. But my brain will not believe the lie of "pretend it's Lent starting tomorrow;" I need some other bounds in place. I could try for a month?[^9] See where that gets me. Then I would still have my phone around, just not be engaging in phone-rotting behavior. 

Again, while I think I could do this, I know this would be effortful. And my life is already effortful enough as it is. 

Oh! I also spent the past week or so trying to notice *when* I feel the need to phone around.[^10] And a large majority of the time, the urge comes up when a *waiting period* is presented. Waiting for humidity to go down for improved lab signal? Phone. Don't know what to do for the day, or how to start something? Wait around until I figure it out and phone. Awkward bit of time between things? Phone. This all boils down to an urge to *do something.* My attention must be placed somewhere, at all times.[^11] But the phone is not a neutral agent (party?). It, too, is a herring.[^12] 

Hmmm. I am also noticing that today in particular, I feel quite lucid. Aware? Grounded? I see the desire and can let it go. A) what a joyous feeling, I hope to savor this. B) maybe instead removing a negative action, I can insert a positive one? Every so often I see praise of "the Artist's Way," which, to my limited understanding, starts the day with free association writing? Maybe, if I make time to do that during my mornings, I'll more grounded to response to the day's proceedings, and can more easily avoid what will not serve me. 

Wow! What a departure from Version 1. Both can go up, and we'll[^13] mull on Version 2 a while.
