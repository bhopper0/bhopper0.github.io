### Draft 1
I return because I want to write. Whether it’s bad, whether it’s not about what I originally wanted to write about, it just keeps returning to me. I keep returning to it. I’m doing exactly what I described as well – I’m not writing the fiction I wanted to write earlier this evening – and yet, tonight I cannot find it within myself to feel bad about this. I guess I’m just happy to be doing anything at all. Creating, instead of consuming, even if it is using a shitty (but expensive, the worst combination) mechanical keyboard,[^1] which feels uncomfortable on my fingers and which doubles up a random assortment of letters for no reason. (A painter with only dirty brushes, a calligrapher  with a pen that skips ink).

This, in a way, is still creative writing. Is, definitively, I suppose. 

But I read back over my previous works, that only I am and shall be privy to, and... my god, some of it is really quite good. Some of it is enjoyable to read, and reread. There are sentences that make me think: wow, maybe I *can* write. Or, to put a finer point on it: some sentences give the impression of a style, one which I enjoy to both write and read. So, really, if I want to reframe the problem, it's that my application of writing style is just, inconsistent. Unfortunate, but not unheard-of, and not at all impossible to fix.

The analytic part of me wants to analyze (obviously): how would I describe my style, if I summarized it, could I apply it more consistently etc etc. But this is a intellectual red herring. A red herring with sparkly scales, but a herring nonetheless. It separates me from the *doing*, a life lesson I am currently attempting to learn/actualize. 

There are any number of ways to do anything, and writing is not an exception to this. What is my way of writing? (Just off the dome, it seems currently: dark, silent, solitary, tea nearby). But that's only the environment. My first instinct says to *plan*. Plan the plot, flesh out the characters, develop everything off the page, so everything can be in-line when I do write. This thought is a trap. Planning, for me, with creative endeavors, is a trap. It's a red herring with sparkly scales that flew out of the river and landed into my lap. It even had a recipe on how to cook herring tucked in its little fin. I can plan forever. I can think about how to do things forever. The instinct to think instead of do is so ingrained that it's veering into fatal flaw territory. 

And at the end of the day, folks, we all know the true identity of the herring. We know who this fish really is.

Say it with me now: perfectionism.



[^1]: I've since replaced this keyboard (because it truely was driving me insane) and readers, I am in love with the new one. Imagine smooth river stones tumbling over each other, and no errant letters to be found.
